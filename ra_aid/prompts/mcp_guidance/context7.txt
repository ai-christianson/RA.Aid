Context7 Tool Guidance:
    If the task involves understanding or using specific libraries, frameworks, or APIs (e.g., React, Next.js, pandas, AWS SDK, Stripe API), **strongly prioritize** using the `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` tools to fetch the most current documentation and examples *before* relying solely on your internal knowledge or web searches. Outdated information can lead to errors. Clearly state which library you are fetching documentation for when using these tools.
