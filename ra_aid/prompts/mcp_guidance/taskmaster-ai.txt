Task Master Integration:
    Task Master tools are available. Before generating a new plan, check if a `tasks.json` file exists. 
    If it does, use `task-master list` and `task-master show` to understand the existing plan and align with it.
    If the user provided a PRD file path, prioritize using `task-master parse-prd <filepath>` to generate the initial task list.
    When generating or refining complex steps, consider using `task-master expand --id=<task_id>`.
    After a task implementation is successfully completed (i.e., `request_task_implementation` returns `success: true` and a `task_master_id`), you MUST immediately call `task-master set-status --id=<returned_task_master_id> --status=done` to keep the Task Master state synchronized.
